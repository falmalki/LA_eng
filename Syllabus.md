## Exercise Sets
- The following exercises are taken from the course textbook. 
- The aim is to make students aware of how to read questions and apply their knowledge to solve them. 
- Many problems share same idea. The instructor should work with the students to understand the main requirements of each set. 
- Engineering applications can be mentioned during the course.
